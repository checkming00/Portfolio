I once tried to choose a school for my child. 

School folder including a python script and a Tableau file.

OA.xlsx is the original table downloaded from school board website.

The py script is for scrapying schools addresses and phone then save as OA2.xlsx.

Then I used internet resource to generate latitudes and longitudes for each school.

The Tableau file is a map visualization displaying the locations of schools as well as availability.
